I am a Ph.D in Molecular and Cellular Biology, formerly working in the [Cartwright](http://cartwrig.ht) lab in the Biodesign Institute Center for Evolutionary Medicine and Informatics at Arizona State University. I am a computational biologist interested in studying evolution and population genetics in a spatial context. Most of my research focuses on consequences of isolation-by-distance, a phenomenon which results in the formation of spatial genetic structure in a population due to limited dispersal. I have developed several spatially-explicit individual based simulations to better understand how isolation-by-distance is affected by different dispersal distributions and different mating types. I am also working on developing a Bayesian method for estimating neighborhood size which roughly quantifies the spatial-genetic structure in a population due to isolation-by-distance.
