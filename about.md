Dr. Furstenau (Ph.D. Molecular and Cellular Biology, Arizona State University) is a postdoctoral scholar in the [Fofanov Lab](http://www.fofanovlab.us/) in the [School of Informatics, Computing, and Cyber Systems](http://nau.edu/siccs/) at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona. She is interested in the development and application of computational and statistical methods to analyze genomic sequence data. She is currently involved with several projects in the Fofanov lab, including the development of a PCR amplicon-based pathogen detection panel as well as the construction of a bioinformatic pipeline which uses metagenomic sequence data to provide species level classification of organisms within complex samples.

Dr. Furstenau was formerly a Ph.D. student in the [Cartwright](http://cartwrig.ht) lab at the Biodesign Institute, Human and Comparative Genomics Laboratory at Arizona State University. Her previous research focused on consequences of isolation-by-distance, a phenomenon which results in the formation of spatial genetic structure in a population due to limited dispersal. Her previous work involved developing simulations and statistical methods for analyzing spatial population genetic data. These projects are available on [Github](https://github.com/tfursten).
