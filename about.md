I am currently an assistant research professor working in the [Fofanov Lab](http://www.fofanovlab.us/) in the [School of Informatics, Computing, and Cyber Systems](http://nau.edu/siccs/) at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona. I am interested in the development and application of computational and statistical methods to analyze genomic sequence data. I am currently involved with several projects in the Fofanov lab, including the development of VaST, a program which finds the minimum number of variant genomic sites which will differentiate all known strains of a bacterial species. VaST was specifically designed to help build panels that will work well in an PCR amplicon sequencing protocol. I am also working on a related piece of software that will help design optimized sets of primers for these reactions.
  		  
I earned my Ph.D. in Molecular and Cellular Biology working in the [Cartwright Lab](http://cartwrig.ht) in the Human and Comparative Genomics Laboratory at the Biodesign Institute at Arizona State University. My previous research focused on consequences of isolation-by-distance, a phenomenon which results in the formation of spatial genetic structure in a population due to limited dispersal. As a part of this work, I developed simulations and statistical methods for analyzing spatial population genetic data.
